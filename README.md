# introduction_to_data_visualisation_pluralsight
Data visualisation techniques with Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy

This repository is based on the course Introduction to Data Visualisation on PluralSight. I have learnt how to open csv files
with pandas and how to represent data in many different ways in matplotlib (histograms, bar charts, line graphs,
and scatter plots). Finally, there was some useful ideas on what to do if your data is too big - data aggregation and random
sampling.
